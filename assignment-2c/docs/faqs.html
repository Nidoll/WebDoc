        <h2 class="h2heading-left">What is your mission?</h2>
        <p class="text-left">
          We aim to reduce the waste found in our forests. The more waste there
          is, the worse trees and other plants can grow. You can also read about
          the impact on our <a href="About-us.html">About page</a>. Healthy
          forests are necessary to combat climate change, therfore we dedicated
          our resources to help them.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2heading-left">Why did you create this company?</h2>
        <p class="text-left">
          We want to help combat climate change as much as possible. We asked
          ourselves what the best way to do this is and came to the conclusion
          that not enough is done to make sure these important CO2 absorbers
          stay healthy. Trees are useful to improve the overall air quality
          which is why we decided to make sure they can do their job.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2heading-left">How can I help?</h2>
        <p class="text-left">
          Please look at our "<a href="Donate.html">Support Us</a>" pages.
          There you can donate, buy some merchandise or get advice on how to
          take action yourself.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2heading-left">Where are you located?</h2>
        <p class="text-left">
          We have multiple locations throughout Germany. You can find these on
          our <a href="Contact-us.html">contact page</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2heading-left">Are you planning to go international?</h2>
        <p class="text-left">
          Although we'd like to expand our operation to more countries in the
          future, there currently are no specific plans to do so. Currently
          we're sadly too small to do this in an efficient way but we'll update
          you as soon as there are plans.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2heading-left">
          Is it really that important to keep the forests clean?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-left">
          Inorganic waste doesn't decompose easily which can lead to plant roots
          not being able to penetrate the surface or rain water not reaching the
          soil leading to too few minerals getting to the trees. Given enough
          waste, this will hinder the growth of trees and will eventually kill
          the forest. Furthermore it can lead to contaminated water sources.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2heading-left">Are you operating carbon neutral?</h2>
        <p class="text-left">
          Yes! In fact, we're offsetting more CO2 than we emit. Additionally,
          our cause helps to lower the CO2 concentration by creating healthier
          forests.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2heading-left">
          Are you able to help out with our project X?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-left">
          If you have a project that might fit our mission, please
          <a>get in touch with us.</a> Then we can discuss the details and see
          how we can help.
