            Then our merchandise shop is right for you. Please note that this

            However, you can see some of the things we sell on here. As soon
            as the merchandise shop is up and working, the items listed will
            redirect to our actual shop.

              While we don't produce these items ourselves, we only choose the
              best partners to do so on our behalf. This benefits you because
              we're able to offer lower prices by utilizing a larger
              production mechanism and benefits us as we can better focus on
              our mission while still giving you something to enjoy. It is
              important for us that our products are climate-neutral and made
              only with high-quality ressources. These of course have to align
              with out objectives. This means that we take care to only use
              suppliers who respect our conditions: No forests should be
              harmed (this is a concern especially with cotton), the transport
              distance should be kept to a minimum, any carbon emissions
              created by this are to be offset by investing in other projects
              and every employee along the way (as well as farmers) should be
              receiving a fair wage. By setting these conditions we're able to
              ensure that what you receive is a good item produced in an
              environmentally friendly and morally correct way.
