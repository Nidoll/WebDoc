                I am Tom Brose the original founder of the forest sweepers. I
                always loved going out in the woods. As a child I played for
                hours in the forest without it ever getting boring. So, it was a
                big shock as I first realized how bad some people treat nature.
                As I first saw that huge pile of garbage in the forest just
                behind my old home, I know I had to do something. I founded the
                forest sweepers to make nature as beautiful as it originally
                was.
