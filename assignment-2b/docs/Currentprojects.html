                    <h3>Our Projects</h3>
                    <p>We currently have multiple projects ongoing. They mostly focus on cleaning the forest, but that’s
                        not all we do. We also have projects that focus on further education. This can help to protect
                        the forest before it gets polluted. Our cleaning projects are straight forward, we search for
                        parts of the forest that are heavily polluted and clean them. Its always disturbing to see the
                        nature in such horrible conditions. Its also a huge health risk for the animals. This is part of
                        our other projects. We try to educate people on their impact on the hole ecosystem. Often, they
                        aren’t aware of what damage they can do with their action.</p>

                    <h3>Our Projects</h3>
                    <p>We currently have ongoing projects in Brandenburg, Bavaria, Nordrhein-Westfalen, and Saarland.
                        We mostly focus on cleanup in these regions. We would like to extend our influence in other
                        regions but currently don’t have the capacity. We have multiple cleanup teams in every of the
                        four regions. We already made good progress in tidying up the forest and helping the
                        environment. We only have one teaching team in Brandenburg but would like to expand our
                        influence. We already showed a lot of people an environment friendly way of living. It already
                        reduced the new waste that gets thrown in the forest. We hope to continue our ongoing projects
                        and protect many more forests.</p>
