We have big plans for the future. We not only want to help in Germany but also 
all around the world. Our current plans are to expand in Europe and later 
expand in other regions like Asia or America. Of course, our final goal is to 
help every forest in the world. We know that this is very ambitious of us, but 
we believe we can do it. We also plan to work together with other companies and 
investors to quickly increase our influence.

Some examples of future projects are the currently planned reforestation in 
Bavaria. We made planes to work with local businesses to gather enough help for 
this big Project. Another planned project is the expansion into the regions Saxony 
and Hessen. We are currently working together with the local forest rangers in 
these regions. We planning to build local branches in both of these regions. 
We will start with cleaning the forests there and also try to build teaching 
facilities to prevent future pollution. We hope to spread our influence all across 
the globe.
