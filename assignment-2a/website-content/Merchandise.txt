Do you want to support us and receive something nice in return? Then our
merchandise shop is right for you. Here you can order various items designed
by us to help you spread the word.

While we don't produce these items ourselves, we only choose the best partners
to do so on our behalf. This benefits you because we're able to offer lower prices
by utilizing a larger production mechanism and benefits us as we can better
focus on our mission while still giving you something to enjoy. It is important
for us that our products are climate-neutral and made only with high-quality
ressources. These of course have to align with out objectives. This means that
we take care to only use suppliers who respect our conditions: No forests should
be harmed (this is a concern especially with cotton), the transport distance should
be kept to a minimum, any carbon emissions created by this are to be offset by investing
in other projects and every employee along the way (as well as farmers) should be
receiving a fair wage. By setting these conditions we're able to ensure that
what you receive is a good item produced in an environmentally friendly and 
morally correct way.
