Here we want to have a donation field where the user can set an amount, 
check if he wants to donate automatically (monthly/yearly) and what 
payment method he would like to use.


Main content:

Please consider donating. With your financial support we can continue to clean our forests.
If you want to contribute regularly, you can do that by checking "Donate regularly" and then
choosing between the given options. All common payment methods are available.
If you want something back, you might be interested in our new <a>merchandise shop</a>.

You only have a few bucks in your pocket and think that wouldn't help? We want you to know,
that even the smallest donation can make a difference. And if you don't have the financial means
you can even help without money. Help spread the word or consider viewing our "Take Action" Page
and learn what you can do to make our forest clean again.
