We are The Forest Sweepers, a family-owned business with a simple goal. Making our
forests clean again. The truth is, that our green save haven is polluted with all
kinds of waste. Apart from the fact that it doesn't look nice, it can also be dangerous.
For example, glass in combination with sun rays can potentially lead to a fire destroying
everything around. Because healthy forests are necessary to combat climate change, we
founded our company. Our network is deeply branched into many locations in Germany. Thatâ€™s
why we can operate many cleaning projects simultaneously. The different offices are managed
through our headquarter in Berlin. Our large number of <a>committed team members</a> is ready for
all kinds of projects.

We also encourage everyone to help us with cleaning and protecting the environment.
Please visit the <a>Take Action page</a> to learn more about the various ways to become
involved and help make a difference!
