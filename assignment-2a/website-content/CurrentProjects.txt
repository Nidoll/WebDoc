We currently have multiple projects ongoing. They mostly focus on cleaning the 
 forest, but that’s not all we do. We also have projects that focus on further 
education. This can help to protect the forest before it gets polluted. Our 
cleaning projects are straight forward, we search for parts of the forest that 
are heavily polluted and clean them. Its always disturbing to see the nature in 
such horrible conditions. Its also a huge health risk for the animals. This is 
part of our other projects. We try to educate people on their impact on the hole 
ecosystem. Often, they aren’t aware of what damage they can do with their action.

We currently have ongoing projects in Brandenburg, Bavaria, Nordrhein-Westfalen, 
and Saarland. We mostly focus on cleanup in these regions. We would like to 
extend our influence in other regions but currently don’t have the capacity. We 
have multiple cleanup teams in every of the four regions. We already made good 
progress in tidying up the forest and helping the environment. We only have one 
teaching team in Brandenburg but would like to expand our influence. We already 
showed a lot of people an environment friendly way of living. It already reduced 
the new waste that gets thrown in the forest. We hope to continue our ongoing 
projects and protect many more forests.
