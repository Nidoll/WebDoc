Because our mission is not one that we can achieve alone, we are very blessed to
have such generous partners that help us to clean the forests. We are also looking
for more partnerships with companies or organizations that want to make a difference.
Please get in touch with us!

Our partners are:
- Bundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft
The Bundesministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft is supporting us by including
us in their project "WALDWÄRTS" that aims to protect the forests in Germany.

- Schutzgemeinschaft Deutscher Wald e.V.
We work hand in hand with this association to coordinate our projects.

- Deutsche Telekom
The Telekom supports us via financial contributions that we can use to fulfill our projects.
