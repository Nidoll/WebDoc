A lot of people often donâ€™t know how bad the state of our forests can be. We    
want to open your eyes a little bit and show you some examples of forest 
pollution. Keep in mind that this has not only impact on the plants, but also 
in the animals that live there. It can even impact the ground water and 
therefore has an impact on you.

But not everything is bad and its never too late to change something. We also 
want to show you the fruits of our work. This is our goal and what we want to 
protect. Imagine a world with no waste in the environment so that everyone can 
live healthy.
