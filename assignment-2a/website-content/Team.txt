We at The Forest Sweepers are an ever-growing team of passionate               
environmentalists. We are like a big family, and all try to improve our world 
together. Everyone works voluntarily and tries to help where he can. We have 
different teams all across the country. They try to cover as much area as 
possible, in as many places as possible. While every Team works somewhat 
independent in their area, we regularly have meetups to coordinate our efforts.

If you want to join our team, we would really appreciate it. We can use every 
helping hand and have always enough work to keep everyone busy. If you want to 
join our team, just write an email, or give us a call. You can even visit us if 
you want to take a look at our work first. Everyone can help and can always 
make a difference. If you have the time to take action, just go for it.
