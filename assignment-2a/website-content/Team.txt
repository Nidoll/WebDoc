I am Tom Brose the original founder of the forest sweepers. I always loved 
going out in the woods. As a child I played for hours in the forest without it 
ever getting boring. So, it was a big shock as I first realized how bad some 
people treat nature. As I first saw that huge pile of garbage in the forest just 
behind my old home, I know I had to do something. I founded the forest sweepers 
to make nature as beautiful as it originally was.

I am Max Ratins the second team member of the forest sweepers. Just like Tom I 
was always a forest child. So, as I heard he needs help with a passion project 
of him I instantly said yes. Together we try to protect the flora and fauna of 
the local forests. I mostly work hands on together with Tom but over the years I
 also have to manage some organization questions.

I am Laura Muse the third team member of the forest sweepers. I mostly work
 behind the back and try to manage the organization. Of course, do I like to 
protect the forest too, but you always need someone to deal with the paperwork. 
It is also important to remember that everyone can help in different ways, so 
you donâ€™t have to be directly hands on.
