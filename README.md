### Mission and Services
We are The Forest Sweepers, a family-owned business with a simple goal. Making our forests clean again. Our network is deeply branched into many locations in Germany. That’s why we can operate many cleaning projects simultaneously. The different offices are managed through our headquarter in Berlin. Our large number of committed team members is ready for all kinds of projects. We also encourage everyone to help with cleaning and protecting our valuable forests.

Based on the client’s needs, we offer a wide range of tidy-up services. With the help of our new website, we want to promote our business, encourage people to help by taking action, donating or shopping in our merchandise shop. We also want to reach potential new workers for our projects.
